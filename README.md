# 📘 Electromechanical Design — Bearing Selection Tool

## 🛠 Overview

This project contains an automated Python tool that selects the optimal bearings for the input shaft of a mechanical assembly.
The script computes loads, life, safety factors, and geometric constraints to help designers choose bearings efficiently and accurately.

The repository also includes CAD files related to the input shaft assembly and overall electromechanical design.

## ✨ Features

- Automated parsing of bearing data (CSV)
- Calculates:
  - Equivalent dynamic/static loads
  - L10 and L10h bearing life
  - Safety factors
  - Geometry & fit constraints
  - Filters and ranks candidate bearings
  - Outputs recommended bearing options with full calculation breakdown
  - Includes CAD models of the assembly for reference or modification
